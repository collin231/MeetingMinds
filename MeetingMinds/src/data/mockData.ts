    summarizer: "This product strategy meeting covered three key areas: market positioning, competitive analysis, and feature prioritization for Q1. The team discussed shifting focus toward mobile-first development and implementing new user onboarding flows. Five stakeholders participated, representing product, engineering, design, marketing, and customer success teams.",
    requirements: "Based on the engineering planning discussion, the following requirements were identified: implement user authentication system, develop responsive design framework, integrate third-party analytics, establish CI/CD pipeline, and create comprehensive testing suite. All requirements align with the Q1 roadmap and technical architecture decisions.",
    questions: "The customer feedback review revealed several areas requiring stakeholder clarification. Key questions emerged around user experience priorities, feature adoption metrics, support escalation processes, and integration requirements with existing systems.",
    breakdown: "The Q1 budget discussion outlined major project initiatives that can be broken down into specific tasks. The conversation covered resource allocation, timeline dependencies, risk assessment, and success metrics for each initiative.",
    estimator: "The design system updates discussion focused on evaluating the impact and feasibility of proposed changes. The team assessed technical complexity, resource requirements, timeline implications, and potential risks for each update."
